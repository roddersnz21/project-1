                    Making neapolitan style pizza for over 20 years
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Hero Pizza is a family owned pizzeria crazy about pizza. Our main focus is to offer the best
                    Neapolitan style pizza in Dublin.
                    We are the first pizzeria to open in Blanchardstown, our pizzas are freshly made and baked in a
                    woodfire oven. We have been making the best
                    pizzas since 1998, always bringing excellent quality, unforgettable flavours and great service.
                    That's how we conquered our loyal customers
                    and became one of the top pizzerias in Ireland.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Fresh Ingredients
                </h3>
                <p>We use quality ingredients such as organically grown flours, vegetables and herbs.
                    Taking advantage of the many raw materials that our suppliers offer and constantly continuing in the
                    search for the best Italian gastronomic excellence.
                    The integration between the ingredients and their mixing allows us to create new proposals and
                    continuously update the menu.
