# **Hero Pizza**
<br>

## **Purpose** ##

Hero Pizza is a family owned Italian pizzeria based in Dublin 15 for over 20 years. We are passionate about Neapolitan style pizza and aim to deliver the best pizza in Dublin. Our suppliers are locally sourced in Ireland and we use fresh and organic produce and flour. Our state of the art wood fire oven comes from Italy giving the typical Neapolitan crispy crust and soft pizza.<br><br> This website has about us, pizza menu, contact details and booking form sections with a confirmation page after booking is successful.
